This agreement shall begin on the 28th of March 2022

## Software Covered

This agreement governs access to and use of the source code for the software listed below, referred to as the "Software."

The foregoing is provided free of charge or royalties by Artemiy Pavlov as part of a content promotion partnership.


## Terms & Conditions

Both the Licensee and the Software Provider agree to abide by the terms and conditions listed below.

The Software Provider, with the acceptance of this source code licencing agreement, has authorised use of this source code for the purpose of inclusion in the form of plugin within synthesizer products sold by the Licensee.

This licence is non-transferable and perpetual.

The licence provided is valid for, as well as any employees or subcontractors performing services for the Licensee.

“Software” shall be defined as all source codes, object codes, link libraries, utility programmes, project files, and scripts connected to the software stated above throughout this agreement.

At all times, the Software will be the intellectual property of the Software Provider.


## License Grant

The Licensee shall have the non-exclusive and non-transferable rights as described below in consideration of all terms and conditions specified within this contract.

The Licensee will have the right to build the Software sources and include the binary products, dynamically and/or statically linked as part of its synthesizer products.

The Licensee shall have the right to distribute the binary products and/or libraries to its customers separately from the synthesizer product as part of system update/upgrade packages, as well as any other form required in the process of troubleshooting customers.


## Restrictions

The following restrictions apply unless prior written authorization by the Software Provider is provided.

 * The Software's source codes, and/or header files shall not be disclosed and/or distributed outside the Software Provider's organization.
 * Any notifications in or on the software, as well as any documentation supplied with the product, shall not be altered or removed.
 * Any Software distribution in a format not specified in this document, that was not agreed upon with the Software Provider, shall not be allowed. 

All software included in this source code licence agreement, as well as all accompanying documentation, is supplied "as is."

The Licensee may report any faults, missing features, or other concerns with the source code.

The Software Provider shall make a best effort to resolve issues reported by the Licensee, but reserves a right of refusal.

In the event that the Software Provider refuses to address an issue reported by the Licensee, or fails to respond in a timely manner, the Licensee obtains the right to modify the Software in any way necessary to resolve the issue.

Under no circumstances will either party or its representatives be liable to the other for any incidental, consequential, or indirect damages, including but not limited to lost or damaged data, revenue loss, economic loss, or commercial loss, resulting from a breach of any of the terms and conditions set forth in this source code licence agreement.

Regardless of whether the alleged violation is a fundamental breach or a fundamental provision, this limitation of liability will apply.

Both parties are aware that some countries may not allow the exclusion of liability for consequential damages, so the aforementioned limitation may not apply to them.
