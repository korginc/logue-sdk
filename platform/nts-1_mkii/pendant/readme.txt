Parameters:

1. shape - compress the first half of the waveform (d in paper), greater value increases overall phase distortion
2. alt - increase number of additional cycles of waveform (v in paper), greater value shifts the spectral peak upwards, the harmonics are a bit like Mogolian throat singing
3. wave - continuously morph the raw wavetable from sin to parabolic to square and to saw, which tends to sound harsh

Tips:

modulate the shape parameter with LFO to get some Aye-Yai-Yai!
